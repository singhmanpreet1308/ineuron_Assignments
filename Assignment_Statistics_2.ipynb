    "Conclusion: The critical value of Chi-Square for a 0.05 significance level and 3 d.f. is 7.82. Our obtained Chi-Square value is bigger than this, and so we conclude that our obtained value is unlikely to have occurred merely by chance. In fact, our obtained value is bigger than the critical Chi-Square value for the 0.01 significance level (13.28). In other words, it is possible that our obtained Chi-Square value is due merely to chance, but highly unlikely: a Chi-Square value as large as ours will occur by chance only about once in a hundred trials. It seems more reasonable to conclude that our results are not de to chance, and that the data do indeed suggest that voters do not prefer the four candidates equally.\n",
